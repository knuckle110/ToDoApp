●This application is a to-do app designed for easily distracted people. Its purpose is to force your attention back by default showing only the highest priority task at a time, enabling you to process tasks one by one.

●How to Use
① Enter tasks. Register tasks via “Enter/Edit”.
② Registered tasks are added to either “STUCK” or “OTHER”.
③ Designate the task you need to tackle first as FP (First Priority).
④ Once complete, press “Complete” and designate the next task as FP to start working on it.
⑤ Rearrange freely. Skillfully swap tasks between “FP” and “STUCK” to designate the highest priority task, then focus on completing them one by one.

Wishing you all a productive work life.


●Term Explanations
FP…First Priority Task. When working, focus solely on this task.

STUCK… Tasks with moderately high priority. Maximum of 5 items. Keep this low to avoid distractions and prevent overloading your brain's memory. Use it flexibly, swapping with “FP” as needed.

OTHER… Freely add tasks here, from bath time to diaper changes. The number of items you can register is virtually unlimited. Writing them down is crucial to avoid wasting mental energy. Promote any that become high-priority to “STUCK”.

Completed Tasks... Displays tasks you've finished so far. Review them later to boost your self-esteem.

List Mode... While this app's purpose is to focus intensely on just one FP task at a time, you might forget what tasks you've registered. Use this mode for an instant overview.
